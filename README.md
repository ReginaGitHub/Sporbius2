# Sporbius

According to the straits times news, there is an increase in the number of people focusing more on their personal health and wellness. Due to the fact that the current covid-19 restrictions are starting to ease, more sports activities are allowed to proceed in bigger groups. In addition, we are seeing an increase in the demand for private coaches and room for people to get active. Although there is an abundance of sports resources, people aren't able to physically get feedback through virtual resources. (Kwek, 2021)
We would also like to highlight that it is very difficult for private coaches to find students who are willing to pay for lessons. This has affected their livelihoods and earnings. Therefore our platform can utilize a  consumer to consumer business model which pairs private coaches to newer students that wish to reach a wider customer base.
Acknowledging the potential of finding a coach website, our group aims to create a platform to help people find their suitable coach and also to widen the consumer base of private coaches.
